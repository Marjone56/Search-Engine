# Search-Engine
Wikipedia Search Engine that uses self-implemented hash tables to showcase the quick build time of the dat astructure.

Download the files and place them in the same Java IDE. The test files use JUNIT and test each function of the search engine and hash table. The dataset includes several wikipedia files as example, feel free to use the dataset provided or create your own using other wikipedia files.

Credit: The project uses skeleton code from Nazim Ashraf's C343 Data Structures course along with implementations of Hash Tables and Search Engine created by myself.
